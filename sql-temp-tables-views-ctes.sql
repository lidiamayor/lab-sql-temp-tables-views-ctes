-- Step 1: Create a View
CREATE VIEW customer_rental_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(*) AS rental_count
FROM customer AS c
    JOIN rental AS r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY rental_count DESC;
    
-- Step 2: Create a Temporary Table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_payment_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        crs.customer_id,
        SUM(p.amount) AS total_paid
    FROM 
        customer_rental_summary AS crs
        JOIN rental AS r ON crs.customer_id = r.customer_id
        JOIN payment AS p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id
    GROUP BY 
        crs.customer_id
);

-- Step 3: Create a CTE and the Customer Summary Reportcustomers
WITH customer_summary_report AS(
	SELECT 
		crs.customer_name,
		crs.email,
		crs.rental_count,
		cps.total_paid
	FROM customer_rental_summary AS crs
	JOIN customer_payment_summary AS cps ON crs.customer_id = cps.customer_id)

SELECT *,
    total_paid / rental_count AS average_payment_per_rental
FROM customer_summary_report
ORDER BY rental_count DESC;
